⚙️ Step-by-Step Execution of Client–Server Socket Program in Java
(How the server and client communicate step-by-step (connection → data exchange → close)?)

🧩 You’ll Need

  Java Development Kit (JDK) installed

  A text editor (like Notepad++, VS Code, or IntelliJ IDEA)

  Two terminal/command prompt windows (one for server, one for client)


🖥️ Example Files

  Server.java

  Client.java


🧠 Execution Steps
🪜 Step 1 – Save the Files

Save both files in the same folder, e.g.:

C:\JavaSockets\
   ├── Server.java
   └── Client.java

🪜 Step 2 – Open Two Terminals / Command Prompts

  You’ll need two separate windows:

  One for Server

  One for Client

🪜 Step 3 – Compile Both Programs

In both terminals, navigate to the folder containing the files.

cd C:\JavaSockets
javac Server.java
javac Client.java


This creates Server.class and Client.class files (compiled bytecode).

🪜 Step 4 – Run the Server First

In the first terminal:

java Server


You should see:

Server started. Waiting for client...


This means your server is running and waiting for a client to connect.

🪜 Step 5 – Run the Client

In the second terminal:

java Client


You’ll see:

Connected to server.
Enter message for server:


Type something like:

Hello Server!

🪜 Step 6 – Observe the Communication

On the Server window, you’ll see:

Client connected!
Client says: Hello Server!


On the Client window, you’ll see:

Server replied: Hello Client, message received!


🎉 Congratulations! You’ve successfully run a TCP client-server program!

⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes
Problem	Solution
java.net.BindException: Address already in use	Port 5000 is already used. Try another port, e.g., 5050.
java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused	Make sure the server is started before the client.
java.io.IOException: Connection reset	Ensure both programs close sockets properly.
Firewall blocks connection	Temporarily disable firewall or allow Java network access.

🧩 Bonus: Run on Two Different Computers

If both client and server are on different systems:

Find the server’s IP address using ipconfig (Windows) or ifconfig (Linux/Mac).

Replace "localhost" in client code with that IP:

Socket socket = new Socket("192.168.1.10", 5000);
