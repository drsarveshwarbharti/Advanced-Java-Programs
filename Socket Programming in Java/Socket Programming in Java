What is Socket Programming?

Socket Programming is a way of connecting two nodes (programs) on a network to communicate with each other.

One program acts as a Server, which listens for requests.

Another acts as a Client, which sends requests and receives responses.

It allows data exchange between systems over TCP/IP or UDP protocols.

🔗 Key Concepts
Term	Description
Socket	Endpoint for communication between two machines.
IP Address	Unique identifier for a device on the network.
Port Number	Identifies a specific service or application on a device.
ServerSocket (Java Class)	Used on the server side to listen for and accept incoming connections.
Socket (Java Class)	Used on both sides for sending and receiving data once a connection is established.
TCP	Connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable data transfer.
UDP	Connectionless protocol allowing fast, lightweight communication without reliability.

🖥️ Types of Socket Communication

TCP (Stream-based communication)

  Reliable and ordered data transmission.

  Classes used:

  ServerSocket (Server)

  Socket (Client)

UDP (Datagram-based communication)

  Connectionless and faster, but less reliable.

  Classes used:

  DatagramSocket

  DatagramPacket


How TCP Socket Communication Works
Steps:

Server side: 
  Create a ServerSocket on a specific port.

  Wait for client requests using accept().

  Communicate via input/output streams.

Client side:

  Create a Socket specifying the server IP and port.

  Send data using OutputStream.

  Receive data using InputStream.

Close the connection once communication is complete.
