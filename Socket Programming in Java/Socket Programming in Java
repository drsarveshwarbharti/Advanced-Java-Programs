What is Socket Programming?

Socket Programming is a way of connecting two nodes (programs) on a network to communicate with each other.

One program acts as a Server, which listens for requests.

Another acts as a Client, which sends requests and receives responses.

It allows data exchange between systems over TCP/IP or UDP protocols.

🔗 Key Concepts
Term	Description
Socket	Endpoint for communication between two machines.
IP Address	Unique identifier for a device on the network.
Port Number	Identifies a specific service or application on a device.
ServerSocket (Java Class)	Used on the server side to listen for and accept incoming connections.
Socket (Java Class)	Used on both sides for sending and receiving data once a connection is established.
TCP	Connection-oriented protocol ensuring reliable data transfer.
UDP	Connectionless protocol allowing fast, lightweight communication without reliability.

🖥️ Types of Socket Communication

TCP (Stream-based communication)

  Reliable and ordered data transmission.

  Classes used:

  ServerSocket (Server)

  Socket (Client)

UDP (Datagram-based communication)

  Connectionless and faster, but less reliable.

  Classes used:

  DatagramSocket

  DatagramPacket


How TCP Socket Communication Works
Steps:

Server side: 
  Create a ServerSocket on a specific port.

  Wait for client requests using accept().

  Communicate via input/output streams.

Client side:

  Create a Socket specifying the server IP and port.

  Send data using OutputStream.

  Receive data using InputStream.

Close the connection once communication is complete.


Flow of Execution

  Run Server.java first → It starts listening on port 5000.

  Run Client.java → It connects to the server.

  Exchange messages between client and server.

  Both programs terminate gracefully.


Advantages of Socket Programming

✅ Real-time communication between processes.
✅ Reliable data transfer using TCP.
✅ Works over local networks or the internet.
✅ Can be used for building chat applications, file transfer systems, etc.


What is a Port?

A port is a virtual communication endpoint that helps identify a specific process or service running on a machine.
It works together with the IP address to uniquely identify where data should go.

Think of it like:

🏠 IP address = house number,
🚪 Port number = door number leading to a specific room or service.

⚙️ Port 5000 in Your Code
ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(5000);


This means your server program is listening for client requests on port number 5000.

When a client program connects, it must use the same port number, like this:

Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 5000);


If the client uses a different port, the server won’t recognize the connection request.

🌐 Port Number Range
Range	Description
0 – 1023	Well-known (reserved) ports — used by standard services like HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21), etc.
1024 – 49151	Registered ports — used by user applications and services.
49152 – 65535	Dynamic/private ports — often used temporarily by the system.

Since 5000 is above 1024, it’s a safe user-defined port, perfect for testing socket programs.

📡 Example in Context

Server Side: Opens door 5000 and waits.

Client Side: Knocks on door 5000 to establish a connection.

Once connected, both can send and receive messages.

🧠 Tips:

Always ensure the port is free (not used by another program).

Avoid using reserved ports (0–1023).

Both client and server must use the same port for the connection.

✅ In short:

Port 5000 is just a communication channel number where your server listens and your client connects.
You can replace 5000 with any other free port, e.g., 8080, 9000, etc.
