A simple JSP (JavaServer Pages) program combines HTML with Java code to dynamically generate web content. 
To run it, you need a web server with a JSP/Servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    Hello! The time is now <%= new java.util.Date() %>
</body>
</html>


Explanation:

  The <%= %> tags enclose a Java expression.

  The new java.util.Date() expression retrieves the current date and time.

  When the JSP page is loaded in the browser, the Java expression is evaluated at runtime and its output is embedded into the HTML.


Running a Simple JSP Page (Steps to Run JSP)

  1. Save JSP file using the .jsp extension (e.g., hello.jsp).

  2. Start server (e.g., Apache Tomcat).

  3. Place your application inside the appropriate folder (e.g., webapps for Tomcat).

  4. Open the browser and enter the JSP page URL:

    http://localhost:8080/JSPDemo/hello.jsp
