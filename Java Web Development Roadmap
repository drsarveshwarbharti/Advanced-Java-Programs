🛤️ Java Web Development Roadmap

Step-by-step learning roadmap from Servlets → JSP → Spring Boot, so you can grow from basics to industry-level web development.


🔹 Step 1: Core Java (Pre-requisite)

Before diving into web development:

✅ OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism).

✅ Exception handling.

✅ Collections (List, Map, Set).

✅ Multithreading (basic).

✅ JDBC (Database connectivity with MySQL/PostgreSQL).

🔹 Step 2: Servlets (Foundation of Java Web Apps)

Learn how a web server interacts with Java code.
👉 Topics to cover:

Servlet lifecycle (init(), service(), destroy()).

HttpServlet, doGet, doPost.

HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse.

Request parameters and attributes.

Session management (Cookies, HttpSession).

Deployment in Apache Tomcat (web.xml, annotations).

👉 Mini Projects:

Login/Signup form with validation.

Online feedback form storing data in DB.

🔹 Step 3: JSP (Presentation Layer)

Move UI logic away from Servlets.
👉 Topics to cover:

JSP lifecycle (converted to Servlet internally).

Scriptlets (<% ... %>), Expressions (<%= ... %>), Declarations.

JSP implicit objects (request, session, application).

Directives (<%@ page %>, include, taglib).

JSTL (JSP Standard Tag Library).

MVC pattern using Servlets + JSP.

👉 Mini Projects:

Student Registration System (Servlet = Controller, JSP = View).

Simple online shopping cart.

🔹 Step 4: JDBC + DAO Layer

Learn to separate database logic.
👉 Topics to cover:

JDBC connection pooling.

Prepared Statements.

DAO (Data Access Object) pattern.

MVC with Servlets + JSP + JDBC.

👉 Mini Project:

Employee Management System (CRUD app).

🔹 Step 5: Spring Framework Basics

Before Spring Boot, understand Spring Core concepts:

Dependency Injection (IoC container).

Spring MVC basics.

Spring JDBC / JPA.

🔹 Step 6: Spring Boot (Modern Development)

Now move to Spring Boot for real-world development.
👉 Topics to cover:

Spring Boot setup with Maven/Gradle.

REST APIs with @RestController.

Request mapping (@GetMapping, @PostMapping).

Spring Data JPA (database integration).

Validation (@Valid, @NotNull).

Spring Security basics.

Microservices (Optional, advanced).

👉 Mini Projects:

REST API for Library Management.

Blog/Notes Application (CRUD with DB + REST).

JWT Authentication System.

🔹 Step 7: Deployment & Tools

Learn how to ship your projects.

Deploy WAR to Tomcat.

Spring Boot JAR deployment.

Dockerize your Spring Boot app.

CI/CD basics (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).

📊 Learning Flow
Core Java → JDBC → Servlets → JSP → MVC (Servlet + JSP + JDBC) 
→ Spring Core → Spring Boot → Deployment (Cloud/Docker)

⚡ Tips

Use VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA for coding.

Always version control with Git + GitHub.

Practice small projects after each step.

Move gradually → don’t jump to Spring Boot without Servlets/JSP basics.
